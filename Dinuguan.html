<p> A classic Filipino pork stew, also known as chocolate meat, a savory Filipino stew made of bite-sized pork cooked in pig’s blood, vinegar, and spices, including garlic, onions, and chili peppers. Along with choice pork cuts, it also traditionally includes a variety of offal such as ears, intestines, heart, lungs, and kidneys. While pork is the most popular, other versions also use chicken or beef.<br>
